/*
Create a class called publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of a publication.
From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int); and tape, which adds a playing 
time in minutes (type float). Each of the three classes should have a getdata() function to get its data from 
the user, and a putdata() function to display the data.


Implement a runtime polymorphism in the program. (make necessary assumptions)


Write a main( ) program that creates an array of pointers to publication. In a loop, ask the user for data about 
a particular book or tape, and use new to create an object of type book or tape to hold the data. Put the pointer
to the object in the array. When the user has finished entering the data for all books and tapes, display the
resulting data for all the books and tapes entered, using a for loop and a single statement such as pubarr[j]->putdata();
                                                                                                // (pubarr+j).putdata();
                                                                                                //pubarr[j].putdata();

to display the data from each object in the array.



I guess either book or tape
